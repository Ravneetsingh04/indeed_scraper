About the Job: We're seeking an ambitious, self-driven Applied AI Engineer to join Redesign Health's Engineering team. In this pivotal role, you'll architect, implement, and refine foundational systems, data infrastructure, and intelligent workflows vital for launching and scaling transformative healthcare ventures. You’ll be instrumental in integrating cutting-edge technologies—including AI, advanced analytics, and automation—to build sophisticated GTM, communications, investment, and startup scaling systems that drive measurable business outcomes across our portfolio. Reporting to our Head of Technology, you will collaborate closely with visionary founders and internal teams, becoming the in-house expert and trusted advisor on GTM systems architecture and AI-driven commercial workflows within our global healthcare ecosystem. What You’ll Do: Systems Foundations Architect and implement foundational GTM technology stacks specifically optimized for early-stage healthcare startups, leveraging tools such as Affinity, Clay, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and Ciro. Develop and deploy intelligent workflows, automation, and CRM integrations using platforms like n8n and Phantombuster to accelerate sales, marketing, and customer success outcomes. Establish and maintain rigorous performance frameworks to continuously assess and improve existing technology stacks across our portfolio. AI-Enhanced GTM Workflows Lead discovery, experimentation, and implementation of next-generation AI tools and integrations to enhance venture building, startup scaling, and GTM efficiency, effectiveness, and insight. Mentor founders, operators, and internal stakeholders on best practices in GTM technology, data-driven decision-making, and systems management. Develop sustainable, AI-enabled async learning tools, empowering portfolio companies to independently manage and evolve their GTM technology and strategies. What You’ll Need : We value and actively seek exceptional talent from all backgrounds and experiences, recognizing that excellence takes many forms. While diverse journeys inspire us, we believe the most successful candidates for this role will share the following characteristics: You have spent 5+ years in a technical role within software engineering, applied AI, data science, GTM, RevOps, or similar teams at a venture-backed startup or high-growth environment. You have built sophisticated systems with AI primitives like MCPs, RAG, agentic frameworks, context engineering, and fine-tuning. You are an expert in at least one scripting language (Python, JavaScript, etc.) and proficient in SQL, RESTful APIs, MCPs, and webhooks.

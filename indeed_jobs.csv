AI Engineer,,,,"Company Description Today, when you go to your doctor and get referred to a specialist (e.g., for sleep apnea), your doctor sends out a referral and tells you, “They’ll be in touch soon.” So you wait. And wait. Sometimes days, weeks, or even months. Why? Because too often specialists and medical services are overwhelmed with referrals and the painstakingly manual process it takes to qualify your referral prevents them from getting around to it on time, or sometimes at all. Tennr prevents these delays and denials by making sure every referral gets where it needs to go, with the right info, at the right time. Powered by RaeLM Tennr reads, extracts, and acts on every piece of patient information so providers can capture more referrals, slash denials, and reduce delays.
